However, precise mathematical results on this asymptotic agreement seem to be missing. In this paper, we give results in terms of merging Bayesian and empirical Bayes posterior distributions. We study two notions of merging: Bayesian weak merging and frequentist merging in total variation. We also show that, under regularity conditions, the empirical Bayes approach asymptotically gives an oracle selection of the prior hyperparameters.

For this class, we exploit limiting d-dimensional multivariate Poisson process intensities of the underlying process for inference on all d-vectors exceeding a high marginal threshold in at least one component, employing a censoring scheme to incorporate information below the marginal threshold. We also consider the d-dimensional distributions for the equivalent max-stable process, and perform full likelihood inference by exploiting the methods of Stephenson & Tawn (2005), where information on the occurrence times of extreme events is shown to dramatically simplify the likelihood.

The first, which we explore for signal-plus-noise observations only, proceeds by comparing estimators with and without shrinkage. The second, discussed for general regression models, describes the optimization or selection bias as a double-sided effect, which we call a mirror effect: among the numerous insignificant variables, those with large, noisy values appear more valuable than an arbitrary variable, while in fact they carry more noise than an arbitrary variable. The mirror effect is investigated for Akaike's information criterion and for Mallows' C-p, with special attention paid to the latter criterion as a stopping rule in a least-angle regression routine.

Using simulated data, we show that our method performs better than existing methods when there are nonlinear relationships among the features, and is comparable to methods that assume multivariate normality when the conditional means are linear.

The finite-state space nature of this data augmentation permits us to construct two perfect samplers using bounding chains that take advantage of monotonicity and anti-monotonicity in the target posterior distribution, but both are impractically slow. We demonstrate that a composite algorithm that strategically alternates between the two samplers' updates can be substantially faster than either individually. The speed gains come because the composite algorithm takes a divide-and-conquer approach in which one update quickly shrinks the bounding set for the augmented data, and the other update immediately coalesces on the parameter, once the augmented-data bounding set is a singleton. We theoretically bound the expected time until coalescence for the composite algorithm, and show via simulation that the theoretical bounds can be close to actual performance.", "keywords": ["anti-monotonicity", "bounding chain", "coupling from the past", "data augmentation", "markov chain monte carlo", "monotonicity", "perfect sampling"], "keyword_plus": ["simulation", "mixtures", "distributions"], "university": ["Harvard University"]}, "cite_paper": {"perfection within reach: exact mcmc sampling": {"author": ["Craiu,R.

The envelope model proposed by Cook et al. (2010) was shown to have the potential to achieve substantial efficiency gains by accounting for linear combinations of the response vector that are essentially immaterial to coefficient estimation. This requires in part that the distribution of those linear combinations be invariant to changes in the nonstochastic predictor vector. However, inference based on an envelope is not invariant or equivariant under rescaling of the responses, tending to limit application to responses that are measured in the same or similar units. The efficiency gains promised by envelopes often cannot be realized when the responses are measured in different scales. To overcome this limitation and broaden the scope of envelope methods, we propose a scaled version of the envelope model, which preserves the potential of the original envelope methods to increase efficiency and is invariant to scale changes. Likelihood-based estimators are derived and theoretical properties of the estimators are studied in various circumstances. It is shown that estimating appropriate scales for the responses can produce substantial efficiency gains when the original envelope model offers none.

In many genetic epidemiological studies that aim to estimate causal gene effect on disease, the age-at-onset of disease is subject to censoring. In addition, the mutation carrier or noncarrier status of some individuals may be unknown, due to the high cost of in-person ascertainment by collecting DNA samples or because of the death of older individuals. Instead, the probability of such individuals' mutation status can be obtained from various other sources. When mutation status is missing, the available data take the form of censored mixture data. Recently, various methods have been proposed for risk estimation using such data, but none is efficient for estimating a nonparametric distribution. We propose a fully efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation method, in which we estimate the logarithm of the hazard ratio between genetic mutation groups using B-splines, while applying nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation to the reference baseline hazard function. Our estimator can be calculated via an expectation-maximization algorithm which is much faster than existing methods. We show that our estimator is consistent and semiparametrically efficient and establish its asymptotic distribution.

However, the high computational cost of smoothing splines for large datasets has hindered their wide application.

Except for the univariate case where the Reinsch algorithm is applicable, a smoothing spline for a regression problem with sample size n can be expressed as a linear combination of n basis functions and its computational complexity is generally O(n(3)). We achieve a more scalable computation in the multivariate case by evaluating the smoothing spline using a smaller set of basis functions, obtained by an adaptive sampling scheme that uses values of the response variable. Our asymptotic analysis shows that smoothing splines computed via adaptive basis sampling converge to the true function at the same rate as full basis smoothing splines.

A copula model and monotone I-splines are used and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. In particular, the estimated regression parameters are shown to be semiparametrically efficient.

In the presence of gene-gene interactions, the dimensionality of the feature space becomes extremely high relative to the sample size. This poses a significant methodological challenge in the identification of gene-gene interactions. In this paper, by using a Gaussian graphical model framework, we translate the problem of identifying gene-gene interactions associated with a binary trait D into an inference problem on the difference of two high-dimensional precision matrices that summarize the conditional dependence network structures of the genes. We propose a procedure for testing the differential network globally, which is particularly powerful against sparse alternatives. In addition, a multiple testing procedure with false discovery rate control is developed to infer the specific structure of the differential network. Theoretical justification is provided to ensure the validity of the proposed tests, and optimality results are derived under sparsity assumptions. Through a simulation study we demonstrate that the proposed tests maintain the desired error rates under the null hypothesis and have good power under the alternative hypothesis.

To account for between-study heterogeneity, investigators often employ random-effects models, under which the effect sizes of interest are assumed to follow a normal distribution. It is common to estimate the mean effect size by a weighted linear combination of study-specific estimators, with the weight for each study being inversely proportional to the sum of the variance of the effect-size estimator and the estimated variance component of the random-effects distribution. Because the estimator of the variance component involved in the weights is random and correlated with study-specific effect-size estimators, the commonly adopted asymptotic normal approximation to the meta-analysis estimator is grossly inaccurate unless the number of studies is large. When individual participant data are available, one can also estimate the mean effect size by maximizing the joint likelihood. We establish the asymptotic properties of the meta-analysis estimator and the joint maximum likelihood estimator when the number of studies is either fixed or increases at a slower rate than the study sizes and we discover a surprising result: the former estimator is always at least as efficient as the latter.

Existing methods for estimating a discontinuous regression curve usually assume that the number of jumps in the regression curve is known beforehand, which is unrealistic in some situations. Although there has been research on estimation of a discontinuous regression curve when the number of jumps is unknown, the problem remains mostly open because such research often requires assumptions on other related quantities, such as a known minimum jump size.

A pseudo joint likelihood approach is proposed for estimating the unknown parameters and components via a Monte Carlo em algorithm.

A natural question is whether analogous results hold for other types of adaptive designs. We focus on adaptive enrichment designs, which involve preplanned rules for modifying enrollment criteria based on accrued data in a randomized trial. Such designs often involve multiple hypotheses, e.g., one for the total population and one for a predefined subpopulation, such as those with high disease severity at baseline. We fix the total sample size, and consider overall power, defined as the probability of rejecting at least one false null hypothesis. We present adaptive enrichment designs whose overall power at two alternatives cannot simultaneously be matched by any standard design. In some scenarios there is a substantial gap between the overall power achieved by these adaptive designs and that of any standard design. We also prove that such gains in overall power come at a cost. To attain overall power above what is achievable by certain standard designs, it is necessary to increase power to reject some hypotheses and reduce power to reject others. We demonstrate that adaptive enrichment designs allow certain power trade-offs that are not available when restricting to standard designs.", "keywords": ["adaptive enrichment design", "multiple testing procedure", "overall power"], "keyword_plus": ["clinical-trials", "enrichment designs", "tests"], "university": ["Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Of Public Health", "Johns Hopkins University"]}, "cite_paper": {"adaptive signature design: an adaptive clinical trial design for generating and prospectively testing a gene expression signature for sensitive patients": {"author": ["Freidlin,B", "Simon,R"], "publisher": "clinical cancer research", "publish_date": "2005-11"}, "adaptive and nonadaptive group sequential tests": {"author": ["Jennison,C", "Turnbull,Bw"], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2006-3"}, "adaptive seamless designs: selection and prospective testing of hypotheses": {"author": ["Jennison,Christopher", "Turnbull,Bruce W."], "publisher": "journal of biopharmaceutical statistics", "publish_date": "2007-6"}, "initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the food and drug administration": {"author": ["Kirsch,Irving", "Deacon,Brett J.", "Huedo-Medina,Tania B."], "publisher": "plos medicine", "publish_date": "2008-2"}, "depression: management of depression in primary and secondary care": {"author": ["No Author"], "publisher": "depression: management of depression in primary and secondary care", "publish_date": "2004-6"}, "optimizing randomized trial designs to distinguish which subpopulations benefit from treatment": {"author": ["Rosenblum,M.", "Van Der Laan,M.

Q-learning, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm, is a popular method for estimating optimal sequential decision rules from data. Q-learning requires the modelling of nonsmooth, nonmonotone transformations of the data, complicating the search for adequately expressive, yet parsimonious, statistical models. The default Q-learning working model is multiple linear regression, which not only is misspecified under most data-generating models but also results in nonregular regression estimators, complicating inference. We propose an alternative strategy for estimating optimal sequential decision rules for which the requisite statistical modelling does not depend on nonsmooth, nonmonotone transformed data, does not result in nonregular regression estimators, is consistent under more data-generation models than is Q-learning, results in estimated sequential decision rules that have better sampling properties, and is amenable to established statistical methods for exploratory data analysis, model building and validation.

Once the existence of a causal relationship is established, the precise causal mechanism involved becomes a topic of interest. A particularly popular type of mechanism analysis concerns questions of mediation, i.e., to what extent an effect is direct, and to what extent it is mediated by a third variable. A semiparametric theory has recently been proposed that allows multiply robust estimation of direct and mediated marginal effect functionals in observational studies (Tchetgen Tchetgen & Shpitser, 2012). In this paper we extend the theory to handle parametric models of natural direct and indirect effects within levels of pre-exposure variables with an identity or log link function, where the model for the observed data likelihood is otherwise unrestricted. We show that estimation is generally infeasible in such a model because of the curse of dimensionality associated with the required estimation of auxiliary conditional densities or expectations, given high-dimensional covariates.

First, we consider analogous conditions for the risk difference and allow for a categorical, not just a binary, unmeasured confounder. Second, we provide more stringent thresholds that the maximum of the above-mentioned associations must satisfy, rather than weaker conditions that both must satisfy.

Bivariate survival data with interval sampling arise frequently when disease registries or surveillance systems collect data based on disease incidence occurring within a specific calendar time interval. The initial event is then retrospectively confirmed and the subsequent failure event may be observed during follow-up. In life history studies, the initial and two consecutive failure events could correspond to birth, disease onset and death. The statistical features and bias of observed data in relation to interval sampling were discussed by Zhu & Wang (2012). Here we propose nonparametric estimation of the association between bivariate failure times based on Kendall's tau for data collected with interval sampling. A nonparametric estimator is given, where the contribution of each comparable and orderable pair is weighted by the inverse of the associated selection probability.

The proposed test maintains good power and, in all the cases considered, has greater power than the log-rank test under non-proportional hazards.

In this paper, shape and size parameters are introduced and used to characterize the association between the rate function lambda(.) and a random variable X. Measures of association between X and lambda(.) are defined via shape- and size-based coefficients. Rate-independence of X and lambda(.) is studied through tests of shape-independence and size-independence, where the shapeand size-based test statistics can be used separately or in combination. These tests can be applied when X is a covariable possibly correlated with the recurrent event process through lambda(.) or, in the one-sample setting, when X is the censoring time at which the observation of N(.) is terminated.

If the unknown prevalence is low and the screening test suffers from misclassification, it is also possible to obtain more precise prevalence estimates than those obtained from testing all n samples separately (Tu et al., 1994). In some applications, the individual binary response corresponds to whether an underlying time-to-event variable T is less than an observed screening time C, a data structure known as current status data. Given sufficient variation in the observed C values, it is possible to estimate the distribution function F of T nonparametrically, at least at some points in its support, using the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (Ayer et al., 1955). Here, we consider nonparametric estimation of F based on group-tested current status data for groups of size k where the group tests positive if and only if any individual's unobserved T is less than the corresponding observed C. We investigate the performance of the group-based estimator as compared to the individual test nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator, and show that the former can be more precise in the presence of misclassification for low values of F(t). Potential applications include testing for the presence of various diseases in pooled samples where interest focuses on the age-at-incidence distribution rather than overall prevalence. We apply this estimator to the age-at-incidence curve for hepatitis C infection in a sample of U.S. women who gave birth to a child in 2014, where group assignment is done at random and based on maternal age.

Unfortunately this assumption, which is sometimes referred to as partial interference, may not hold, and moreover existing weighted estimators may have large variances. In this paper we consider weighted estimators that could be employed when interference is present. We first propose a generalized inverse probability-weighted estimator and two Hajek-type stabilized weighted estimators that allow any form of interference. We derive their asymptotic distributions and propose consistent variance estimators assuming partial interference. Empirical results show that one of the Hajek estimators can have substantially smaller finite-sample variance than the other estimators.

The structured density consists of one-dimensional in-sample components that identify the density on such sets.

In non-life insurance, the in-sample area is defined as one triangle and the forecasting area as the triangle which, added to the first triangle, completes a square. In recent approaches, two one-dimensional components are estimated by projecting an unstructured two-dimensional density estimator onto the space of multiplicatively separable functions. We show that time-reversal reduces the problem to two one-dimensional problems, where the one-dimensional data are left-truncated and a one-dimensional survival density estimator is needed. We then use the local linear density smoother with weighted crossvalidated and do-validated bandwidth selectors. Full asymptotic theory is provided, with and without time-reversal.

The points of such a process are random displacements of Poisson point processes defined on the lines of a Poisson line process. Parameter estimation for this model based on moment methods or Bayesian inference is discussed in the case where the underlying Poisson line process is latent. To illustrate the proposed methods, we analyse two-and three-dimensional point pattern datasets. The three-dimensional dataset is of particular interest as it relates to the minicolumn hypothesis in neuroscience, which claims that pyramidal and other brain cells have a columnar arrangement perpendicular to the surface of the brain.", "keywords": ["anisotropy", "bayesian inference", "directional k-function", "minicolumn hypothesis", "poisson line process", "three-dimensional point pattern analysis"], "keyword_plus": ["2nd-order analysis", "patterns", "anisotropy", "models"], "university": ["Unknow", "Aalborg University"]}, "cite_paper": {"spatstat: an r package for analyzing spatial point patterns": {"author": ["Baddeley,A", "Turner,R"], "publisher": "journal of statistical software", "publish_date": "2005-1"}, "stochastic geometry and its applications": {"author": ["Chiu,S.

In this paper, we propose the sparse envelope model, which is motivated by applications where some response variables are invariant with respect to changes of the predictors and have zero regression coefficients. The envelope estimator is consistent but not sparse, and in many situations it is important to identify the response variables for which the regression coefficients are zero. The sparse envelope model performs variable selection on the responses and preserves the efficiency gains offered by the envelope model. Response variable selection arises naturally in many applications, but has not been studied as thoroughly as predictor variable selection. In this paper, we discuss response variable selection in both the standard multivariate linear regression and the envelope contexts. In response variable selection, even if a response has zero coefficients, it should still be retained to improve the estimation efficiency of the nonzero coefficients. This is different from the practice in predictor variable selection. We establish consistency and the oracle property and obtain the asymptotic distribution of the sparse envelope estimator.", "keywords": ["canonical correlation", "dimension reduction", "envelope model", "grassmann manifold", "oracle property"], "keyword_plus": ["covariance estimation", "oracle properties", "mm algorithms", "lasso"], "university": ["University Of Florida", "National University Of Singapore", "Mcgill University", "State University System Of Florida"]}, "cite_paper": {"smoothing proximal gradient method for general structured sparse regression": {"author": ["Chen,Xi", "Lin,Qihang", "Kim,Seyoung"], "publisher": "annals of applied statistics", "publish_date": "2012-6"}, "coordinate-independent sparse sufficient dimension reduction and variable selection": {"author": ["Chen,Xin", "Zou,Changliang", "Cook,R.

Approaches based on modelling the treatment assignment mechanism, along with their doubly robust extensions, have been difficult to motivate using formal likelihood-based or Bayesian arguments, as the treatment assignment model plays no part in inferences concerning the expected outcomes. On the other hand, forcing dependency between the outcome and treatment assignment models by allowing the former to be misspecified results in loss of the balancing property of the propensity scores and the loss of any double robustness. In this paper, we explain in the framework of misspecified models why doubly robust inferences cannot arise from purely likelihood-based arguments.

Thus the proposed model provides an extension of the usual notion of a covariance or correlation matrix for multivariate vector data to functional data vectors and generates an interpretable functional interaction map.

The decomposition of the total variance into componentwise and interaction contributions can be quantified by an R-2-like decomposition.

An optimal percentage for the quantiles can be chosen by minimizing the misclassification error in the training sample.

The results improve upon the general theory of convergence for stochastic partial differential equation models introduced by Lindgren et al. (2011). The new method is demonstrated on a standard point pattern dataset, and two interesting extensions to the classical log-Gaussian Cox process framework are discussed. The first extension considers variable sampling effort throughout the observation window and implements the method of Chakraborty et al. (2011).

We generalize this approach by defining the Fr,chet integral, which depends on the metric chosen for the space of covariance matrices, and demonstrate that ordinary integration is a special case where the Frobenius metric is used. As the space of covariance matrices is nonlinear, we propose a class of power metrics as alternatives to the Frobenius metric. For any such power metric, the calculation of Fr,chet integrals is equivalent to transforming the covariance matrices with the chosen power, applying the classical Riemann integral to the transformed matrices, and finally using the inverse transformation to return to the original scale.

We re-examine this from a different perspective and propose a new estimator for the mean outcome of a target treatment length policy that does not involve a treatment model. Because this strategy avoids modelling the treatment assignment mechanism, the estimator works for both discrete and continuous treatment length data and eschews bias and imprecision that arise as a result of coarsening continuous time data into intervals. We show how the competition of treatment length assignment and terminating event lead to a competing risks problem.

We prove asymptotic normality of the mean of the approximate Bayesian computation posterior.

The censoring times of the two components could be different for patients not experiencing the endpoint event. Conventional approaches, such as taking the minimum of the censoring times of the two components as the censoring time for progression-free survival time, may suffer from efficiency loss and could produce biased estimates of the treatment effect. We propose a new likelihood-based approach that decomposes the endpoints and models both the progression-free survival time and the time from disease progression to death. The censoring times for different components are distinguished.

(2003) considered a regression model with missing response, where the missingness mechanism depends on the value of the response variable and hence is nonignorable. They proposed three pseudolikelihood estimators, based on different treatments of the probability distribution of the completely observed covariates. The first assumes the distribution of the covariate to be known, the second estimates this distribution parametrically, and the third estimates the distribution nonparametrically. While it is not hard to show that the second estimator is more efficient than the first, Tang et al. (2003) only conjectured that the third estimator is more efficient than the first two.

Previous work on nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation for isotonic proportional hazard regression with right-censored data is computationally intensive, lacks theoretical justification, and may be prohibitive in large samples. In this paper, partial likelihood estimation is studied. An iterative quadratic programming method is considered, which has performed well with likelihoods for isotonic parametric regression models. However, the iterative quadratic programming method for the partial likelihood cannot be implemented using standard pool-adjacent-violators techniques, increasing the computational burden and numerical instability. The iterative convex minorant algorithm which uses pool-adjacent-violators techniques has also been shown to perform well in related parametric likelihood set-ups, but evidences computational difficulties under the proportional hazards model. An alternative pseudo-iterative convex minorant algorithm is proposed which exploits the pool-adjacent-violators techniques, is theoretically justified, and exhibits computational stability. A separate estimator of the baseline hazard function is provided. The algorithms are extended to models with time-dependent covariates. Simulation studies demonstrate that the pseudo-iterative convex minorant algorithm may yield orders-of-magnitude reduction in computing time relative to the iterative quadratic programming method and the iterative convex minorant algorithm, with moderate reductions in the bias and variance of the estimators.

This conditional testing procedure is validated through simulation studies.", "keywords": ["boundary problem", "composite likelihood", "likelihood ratio test", "nonstandard inference"], "keyword_plus": ["statistics"], "university": ["University Of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "Unknow", "National Yang Ming University"]}, "cite_paper": {"inference for clustered data using the independence loglikelihood": {"author": ["Chandler,Richard E.", "Bate,Steven"], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2007-3"}, "on pseudolikelihood inference for semiparametric models with boundary problems": {"author": ["Chen,Y.", "Ning,J.", "Ning,Y."], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2017-3"}, "on the asymptotic behaviour of the pseudolikelihood ratio test statistic with boundary problems": {"author": ["Chen,Yong", "Liang,Kung-Yee"], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2010-9"}, "models for discrete longitudinal data": {"author": ["Molenberghs,G.", "Verbeke,G."], "publisher": "models for discrete longitudinal data", "publish_date": "2005-6"}, "adjusting composite likelihood ratio statistics": {"author": ["Pace,Luigi", "Salvan,Alessandra", "Sartori,Nicola"], "publisher": "statistica sinica", "publish_date": "2011-1"}, "r: a language and environment for statistical computing": {"author": ["No Author"], "publisher": "r: a language and environment for statistical computing", "publish_date": "2018-6"}, "likelihood ratio tests with boundary constraints using data-dependent degrees of freedom": {"author": ["Susko,Edward"], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2013-12"}, "an overview of composite likelihood methods": {"author": ["Varin,Cristiano", "Reid,Nancy", "Firth,David"], "publisher": "statistica sinica", "publish_date": "2011-1"}}, "paper_cited": {}}, "on bias reduction and incidental parameters": {"ego_attribute": {"author": ["Lunardon,N."], "publisher": "biometrika", "doi": "10.1093/biomet/asx079", "publish_date": "2018-3", "cited_num": 19, "time_cited": 0, "abstract": "Firth (1993) introduced a method for reducing the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator.

We propose a general, computationally simple, semiparametric method for analysis of case-control studies that allows exploitation of the assumption of gene-environment independence without any further parametric modelling assumptions about the marginal distributions of any of the two sets of factors.

We present a general theoretical study of the behaviour of doubly robust estimators of an average treatment effect when one of the nuisance parameters is inconsistently estimated. We contrast different methods for constructing such estimators and investigate the extent to which they may be modified to also allow doubly robust inference.

A general class of two-stage minimum distance estimators is proposed that separately fits linear models for the outcome and exposure and then uses a minimum distance criterion based on the reduced-form model for the outcome to estimate the regression parameters of interest. An optimal minimum distance estimator is identified which may be superior to the usual two-stage least squares estimator with fully observed data.

Analysis of samples of trees is difficult due to the multi- dimensionality of the space of possible trees. In Euclidean spaces, principal component analysis is a popular method of reducing high- dimensional data to a low- dimensional representation that preserves much of the sample's structure. However, the space of all phylogenetic trees on a fixed set of species does not form a Euclidean vector space, and methods adapted to tree space are needed. Previous work introduced the notion of a principal geodesic in this space, analogous to the first principal component. Here we propose a geometric object for tree space similar to the kth principal component in Euclidean space: the locus of the weighted Frechet mean of k + 1 vertex trees when the weights vary over the k- simplex. We establish some basic properties of these objects, in particular showing that they have dimension k, and propose algorithms for projection onto these surfaces and for finding the principal locus associated with a sample of trees.

In this paper, we consider the identification and estimation problems of the survivor average causal effect. We propose to use a substitution variable in place of the latent membership in the always-survivor group. The identification conditions required for a substitution variable are conceptually similar to conditions for a conditional instrumental variable, and may apply to both randomized and observational studies. We show that the survivor average causal effect is identifiable with use of such a substitution variable, and propose novel model parameterizations for estimation of the survivor average causal effect under our identification assumptions.

However, commonly used reduced-rank methods are sensitive to data corruption, as the low-rank dependence structure between response variables and predictors is easily distorted by outliers. We propose a robust reduced-rank regression approach for joint modelling and outlier detection. The problem is formulated as a regularized multivariate regression with a sparse mean-shift parameterization, which generalizes and unifies some popular robust multivariate methods. An efficient thresholding-based iterative procedure is developed for optimization. We show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge and that the coordinatewise minimum point produced is statistically accurate under regularity conditions. Our theoretical investigations focus on non-asymptotic robust analysis, demonstrating that joint rank reduction and outlier detection leads to improved prediction accuracy. In particular, we show that redescending.-functions can essentially attain the minimax optimal error rate, and in some less challenging problems convex regularization guarantees the same low error rate.

To account for heterogeneity in the capture probabilities, Huggins (1989) and Alho (1990) proposed a semiparametric model in which the capture probabilities are modelled parametrically and the distribution of individual characteristics is left unspecified. A conditional likelihood method was then proposed to obtain point estimates andWald-type confidence intervals for the abundance. Empirical studies show that the small-sample distribution of the maximum conditional likelihood estimator is strongly skewed to the right, which may produceWald-type confidence intervals with lower limits that are less than the number of captured individuals or even are negative. In this paper, we propose a full empirical likelihood approach based on Huggins andAlho's model. We showthat the null distribution of the empirical likelihood ratio for the abundance is asymptotically chi-squared with one degree of freedom, and that the maximum empirical likelihood estimator achieves semiparametric efficiency. Simulation studies show that the empirical likelihood-based method is superior to the conditional likelihood-based method: its confidence interval has much better coverage, and the maximum empirical likelihood estimator has a smaller mean square error.

One difficulty is that probability density functions do not exist for functional data, so the classical Bayes classifier using density quotients needs to be modified. We propose to use density ratios of projections onto a sequence of eigenfunctions that are common to the groups to be classified. The density ratios are then factorized into density ratios of individual projection scores, reducing the classification problem to obtaining a series of one-dimensional nonparametric density estimates. The proposed classifiers can be viewed as an extension to functional data of some of the earliest nonparametric Bayes classifiers that were based on simple density ratios in the one-dimensional case. By means of the factorization of the density quotients, the curse of dimensionality that would otherwise severely affect Bayes classifiers for functional data can be avoided. We demonstrate that in the case of Gaussian functional data, the proposed functional Bayes classifier reduces to a functional version of the classical quadratic discriminant. A study of the asymptotic behaviour of the proposed classifiers in the large-sample limit shows that under certain conditions the misclassification rate converges to zero, a phenomenon that has been referred to as perfect classification. The proposed classifiers also perform favourably in finite-sample settings, as we demonstrate through comparisons with other functional classifiers in simulations and various data applications, including spectral data, functional magnetic resonance imaging data from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder patients, and yeast gene expression data.", "keywords": ["density estimation", "functional classification", "functional principal component analysis", "gaussian process", "quadratic discriminant analysis"], "keyword_plus": ["principal-components-analysis", "gene-expression data", "probability density", "longitudinal data", "classification", "discrimination", "models", "regression", "mri"], "university": ["University Of California Davis", "University Of California System", "Peking University"]}, "cite_paper": {"supervised classification for functional data: a weighted distance approach": {"author": ["Alonso,Andres M.", "Casado,David", "Romo,Juan"], "publisher": "computational statistics &amp; data analysis", "publish_date": "2012-7"}, "functional logistic discrimination via regularized basis expansions": {"author": ["Araki,Yuko", "Konishi,Sadanori", "Kawano,Shuichi"], "publisher": "communications in statistics-theory and methods", "publish_date": "2009-6"}, "supervised classification for a family of gaussian functional models": {"author": ["Baillo,Amparo", "Cuevas,Antonio", "Antonio Cuesta-Albertos,Juan"], "publisher": "scandinavian journal of statistics", "publish_date": "2011-9"}, "common functional principal components": {"author": ["Benko,Michal", "Haerdle,Wolfgang", "Kneip,Alois"], "publisher": "annals of statistics", "publish_date": "2009-2"}, "functional classification in hilbert spaces": {"author": ["Biau,G", "Bunea,F", "Wegkamp,Mh"], "publisher": "ieee transactions on information theory", "publish_date": "2005-6"}, "rates of convergence of the functional k-nearest neighbor estimate": {"author": ["Biau,Gerard", "Cerou,Frederic", "Guyader,Arnaud"], "publisher": "ieee transactions on information theory", "publish_date": "2010-4"}, "inference under functional proportional and common principal component models": {"author": ["Boente,Graciela", "Rodriguez,Daniela", "Sued,Mariela"], "publisher": "journal of multivariate analysis", "publish_date": "2010-2"}, "nearest neighbor classification in infinite dimension": {"author": ["Cerou,F", "Guyader,A."], "publisher": "esaim probab stat", "publish_date": "2006-6"}, "correlation-based functional clustering via subspace projection": {"author": ["Chiou,Jeng-Min", "Li,Pai-Ling"], "publisher": "journal of the american statistical association", "publish_date": "2008-12"}, "clustering longitudinal profiles using p-splines and mixed effects models applied to time-course gene expression data": {"author": ["Coffey,N.", "Hinde,J.", "Holian,E."], "publisher": "computational statistics &amp; data analysis", "publish_date": "2014-3"}, "common functional principal components analysis: a new approach to analyzing human movement data": {"author": ["Coffey,N.", "Harrison,A.

However, in several applied problems the available prior information leads naturally to the incorporation of an atom into the base measure, and then the Dirichlet process is essentially the only tractable choice for the prior. In this paper we fill this gap by considering the Pitman-Yor process with an atom in its base measure. We derive computable expressions for the distribution of the induced random partitions and for the predictive distributions. These findings allow us to devise an effective generalized Polya urn Gibbs sampler.

Surrogate variable analysis, proposed to tackle this problem, has been widely used in genomic studies. To estimate hidden factors that are correlated with the primary variables, surrogate variable analysis performs principal component analysis either on a subset of features or on all features, but weighting each differently. However, existing approaches may fail to identify hidden factors that are strongly correlated with the primary variables, and the extra step of feature selection and weight calculation makes the theoretical investigation of surrogate variable analysis challenging. In this paper, we propose an improved surrogate variable analysis, using all measured features, that has a natural connection with restricted least squares, which allows us to study its theoretical properties.

One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment covariate might have greater bias than estimators that do not adjust for this covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder and affect the outcome only through the treatment.

One salient feature of the proposed method is its capability to identify novel tags absent from a training sample by using their similarity to existing tags. Computationally, the proposed method is implemented by an alternating direction method of multipliers, integrated with a difference convex algorithm. This permits scalable computation. We show that the method achieves accurate tagging, and that it compares favourably with existing methods. Finally, we apply the proposed method to tagging a Reuters news dataset.", "keywords": ["alternating direction method of multipliers", "large margin", "multi-label classification", "scalability", "social bookmarking system", "text mining"], "keyword_plus": ["multivariate binary data", "classification", "regression", "responses", "systems"], "university": ["University Of Minnesota System", "University Of Minnesota Twin Cities", "City University Of Hong Kong", "University Of Illinois System", "University Of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"]}, "cite_paper": {"regularization in statistics": {"author": ["Bickel,Peter J.", "Li,Bo"], "publisher": "test", "publish_date": "2006-12"}, "convex optimization": {"author": ["Boyd,S.", "Vandenberghe,L."], "publisher": "convex optimization", "publish_date": "2004-6"}, "distributed optimization and statistical learning via the alternating direction method of multipliers": {"author": ["Boyd,S.", "Parikh,N.", "Chu,E."], "publisher": "foundations and trends in machine learning", "publish_date": "2010-6"}, "on the global and linear convergence of the generalized alternating direction method of multipliers": {"author": ["Deng,Wei", "Yin,Wotao"], "publisher": "journal of scientific computing", "publish_date": "2016-3"}, "tag recommendations in social bookmarking systems": {"author": ["Jaeschke,Robert", "Marinho,Leandro", "Hotho,Andreas"], "publisher": "ai communications", "publish_date": "2008-6"}, "multilabel text classification for automated tag suggestion": {"author": ["Katakis,I.", "Tsoumakas,G.", "Vlahavas,I."], "publisher": "p ecml pkdd 2008 dis", "publish_date": "2008-6"}, "matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems": {"author": ["Koren,Yehuda", "Bell,Robert", "Volinsky,Chris"], "publisher": "computer", "publish_date": "2009-8"}, "multicategory support vector machines: theory and application to the classification of microarray data and satellite radiance data": {"author": ["Lee,Yk", "Lin,Y", "Wahba,G"], "publisher": "journal of the american statistical association", "publish_date": "2004-3"}, "rcv1: a new benchmark collection for text categorization research": {"author": ["Lewis,Dd", "Yang,Ym", "Rose,Tg"], "publisher": "journal of machine learning research", "publish_date": "2004-4"}, "r: a language and environment for statistical computing": {"author": ["No Author"], "publisher": "r: a language and environment for statistical computing", "publish_date": "2017-6"}, "classifier chains for multi-label classification": {"author": ["Read,Jesse", "Pfahringer,Bernhard", "Holmes,Geoff"], "publisher": "machine learning", "publish_date": "2011-12"}, "discussion: local rademacher complexities and oracle inequalities in risk minimization": {"author": ["Shen,Xiaotong", "Wang,Lifeng"], "publisher": "annals of statistics", "publish_date": "2006-12"}, "efficient visual search of videos cast as text retrieval": {"author": ["Sivic,Josef", "Zisserman,Andrew"], "publisher": "ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "publish_date": "2009-4"}, "automatic tag recommendation algorithms for social recommender systems": {"author": ["Song,Yang", "Zhang,Lu", "Giles,C.

We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric framework for conducting inference in the presence of nonignorable, nonmonotone missingness. This framework focuses on the specification of an auxiliary working prior on the space of complete data generating mechanisms.

The algorithm also provides a novel and efficient solution to the frequentist best subset selection problem for block-diagonal designs. Posterior probabilities for any number of models are obtained by evaluating a single one-dimensional integral, and other quantities of interest such as variable inclusion probabilities and model-averaged regression estimates are obtained by an adaptive, deterministic one-dimensional numerical integration. The overall computational cost scales linearly with the number of blocks, which can be processed in parallel, and exponentially with the block size, rendering it most adequate in situations where predictors are organized in many moderately-sized blocks.

The generalized response is modelled by means of a random threshold, where the subject-specific thresholds are affected by a multiplicative factor that is a function of the distorting covariate. While the various factors are modelled as smooth unknown functions of the distorting covariate, the underlying relationship between response and covariates is assumed to be governed by a generalized linear model with a known link function. This model provides an extension of a covariate-adjusted regression approach to the case of a generalized linear model. We demonstrate that this contamination model leads to a semiparametric varying-coefficient model. Numerical implementation is straightforward by combining binning, quasilikelihood, and smoothing steps. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators for the regression coefficients of the latent generalized linear model is derived by means of a martingale central limit theorem.

In consequence, such classifiers can have poor performance if the information for classification accumulates through a large number of relatively small location differences in data components, rather than via large differences. In this paper, we show that a simple adjustment for scale, applicable to a variety of distance-based classifiers, can remedy the problem. For some classifiers, such as those based on the support vector machine or the centroid method, scale corrections are important primarily in the case of small training-sample sizes. However, for other classifiers, including those based on nearest-neighbour and average-distance methods, scale adjustments are helpful more generally.", "keywords": ["average-distance classifier", "centroid method", "distance-based classifier", "location difference", "nearest-neighbour method", "support vector machine"], "keyword_plus": ["expression data", "classification", "cancer", "discrimination", "recognition"], "university": ["University Of Melbourne"]}, "cite_paper": {"geometric representation of high dimension, low sample size data": {"author": ["Hall,P", "Marron,Js", "Neeman,A"], "publisher": "journal of the royal statistical society series b-statistical methodology", "publish_date": "2005-6"}, "distance-weighted discrimination": {"author": ["Marron,J.

The quasi-randomization theory supporting its use in nonresponse adjustment treats response as an additional phase of random sampling. The functional form of a quasi-random response model is assumed to be known, its parameter values estimated implicitly through the creation of calibration weights. Unfortunately, calibration depends upon known benchmark totals while the covariates in a plausible model for survey response may not be the benchmark covariates. Moreover, it may be prudent to keep the number of covariates in a response model small. We use calibration to adjust for nonresponse when the benchmark model and covariates may differ, provided the number of the former is at least as great as that of the latter. We discuss the estimation of a total for a vector of survey variables that do not include the benchmark covariates, but that may include some of the model covariates. We show how to measure both the additional asymptotic variance due to the nonresponse in a calibration-weighted estimator and the full asymptotic variance of the estimator itself.

To gain power and insight, it can be advantageous to look for influence not at the level of individual variables but rather at the level of clusters of highly correlated variables. We propose a hierarchical approach. Variable importance is first tested at the coarsest level, corresponding to the global null hypothesis. The method then tries to attribute any effect to smaller subclusters or even individual variables. The smallest possible clusters, which still exhibit a significant influence on the response variable, are retained. It is shown that the proposed testing procedure controls the familywise error rate at a prespecified level, simultaneously over all resolution levels.

Standard methods include specifying a single covariance matrix for all groups or independently estimating the covariance matrix for each group without regard to the others, but when these model assumptions are incorrect, these techniques can lead to biased mean effects or loss of efficiency, respectively. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix for each group that will borrow strength across groups in a way that is ultimately informed by the data. In addition, for several groups with covariance matrices of even medium dimension, it is difficult to manually select a single best parametric model among the huge number of possibilities given by incorporating structural zeros and/or commonality of individual parameters across groups. In this paper we develop a family of nonparametric priors using the matrix stick-breaking process of Dunson et al.

The precision matrix in the model specifies a covariate-adjusted Gaussian graph, which presents the conditional dependence structure of gene expression after the confounding genetic effects on gene expression are taken into account. We present a covariate-adjusted precision matrix estimation method using a constrained l(1) minimization, which can be easily implemented by linear programming.

For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-of-regressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset.

For the scaled lasso, the algorithm is a gradient descent in a convex minimization of a penalized joint loss function for the regression coefficients and noise level.

The sample space SE(p) contains objects M=(R,t) where R is a pxp rotation matrix and t is a px1 translation vector. This work is motivated by applications in biomechanics where the posture of a joint at a given time is expressed as MSE(3), the rigid body displacement needed to map a system of axes on one segment of the joint to a similar system on the other segment. This posture can also be reported as M-1=(R-T,-R(T)t) by interchanging the role of the two segments. Several definitions of a Frechet mean for a random motion are proposed using weighted least squares distances. A special emphasis is given to a Frechet mean that is equivariant with respect to the inverse transform; this means that if P is the Frechet mean for M then P-1 is the Frechet mean for M-1, where M is a random SE(p) object. The sampling properties of moment estimators of the Frechet means are studied in a large concentration setting, where the scatter of the random Ms around their mean value P is small, and as the sample size goes to 8. Some simple exponential family models for SE(p) data that generalize Downs' (1972) Fisher-von Mises matrix distribution for rotation matrices are introduced and the least squares mean values for these distributions are calculated. Asymptotic comparisons between the estimators presented in this work are carried out for a particular model when p=2.

In cancer studies, interest could be focused on bivariate failure times, for example, time from birth to cancer onset and time from cancer onset to death. This paper considers a sampling scheme, termed interval sampling, in which the first failure event is identified within a calendar time interval, the time of the initiating event can be retrospectively confirmed and the occurrence of the second failure event is observed subject to right censoring. In a cancer data application, the initiating, first and second events could correspond to birth, cancer onset and death. The fact that the data are collected conditional on the first failure event occurring within a time interval induces bias. Interval sampling is widely used for collection of disease registry data by governments and medical institutions, though the interval sampling bias is frequently overlooked by researchers.

based on independence rules, such as the nearest shrunken centroids classifier (Tibshirani et al., 2002) and features annealed independence rules (Fan & Fan, 2008), have been proposed as

A fundamental drawback of these rules is that they ignore correlations among features and thus could produce misleading feature selection and inferior classification. We propose a new procedure for sparse discriminant analysis, motivated by the least squares formulation of linear discriminant analysis. To demonstrate our proposal, we study the numerical and theoretical properties of discriminant analysis constructed via lasso penalized least squares. Our theory shows that the method proposed can consistently identify the subset of discriminative features contributing to the Bayes rule and at the same time consistently estimate the Bayes classification direction, even when the dimension can grow faster than any polynomial order of the sample size. The theory allows for general dependence among features.

However, when studying the power under a noncontiguous alternative, a large deviations approximation is needed, and the Neyman allocation is no longer asymptotically optimal. In the latter case, the optimal allocation depends on the parameters, but is rather close to a balanced design. Thus, a balanced design is a viable option for both contiguous and noncontiguous alternatives.

In addition, when the missing mechanism is correctly specified, the semiparametric estimator attains the optimal efficiency if E(Y vertical bar X) is recoverable through the working index.

We consider monitoring using CUSUMs based on the partial likelihood ratio between an out-of-control state and an in-control state. We consider both proportional and nonproportional alternatives, as well as a head start. Against proportional alternatives, we present an analytic method of computing the expected number of observed events before stopping or the probability of stopping before a given observed number of events. In a stationary set-up, the former is roughly proportional to the average run length in calendar time.

We then analyze three different models for the error process, calculate exact expressions for the variances, and derive asymptotic variances. Errors in the placement of sample points can lead to substantial inflation of the variance, dampening of zitterbewegung, that is fluctuation effects, and a slower order of convergence. This suggests that the current practice in some areas of microscopy may be based on over-optimistic predictions of estimator accuracy.", "keywords": ["asymptotic variance", "cavalieri estimator", "cumulative error", "moment measure", "perturbed systematic sampling", "point process", "spatial statistics", "stereology"], "keyword_plus": ["geometric-properties", "transitive methods", "number", "precision", "disector", "sections", "tissue", "models", "volume"], "university": ["Eth Zurich", "University Of Western Australia", "Aarhus University"]}, "cite_paper": {"a note on the stereological implications of irregular spacing of sections": {"author": ["Baddeley,A.", "Dorph-Petersen,K.

Nevertheless, including information about prior probabilities can reduce the overall error rate, particularly in cases where doing so is most important, i.e. when the classification problem is particularly challenging and error rates are not close to zero.

Our approach works under mild conditions for the case of densely spaced observations and also can be extended to the important practical situation where the functional predictors are derived from sparse and irregular measurements, as is the case in many longitudinal studies. A key observation is the equivalence of the functional polynomial model with a regression model that is a polynomial of the same order in the functional principal component scores of the predictor processes. Theoretical analysis as well as practical implementations are based on this equivalence and on basis representations of predictor processes. We also obtain an explicit representation of the regression surface that defines quadratic functional regression and provide functional asymptotic results for an increasing number of model components as the number of subjects in the study increases.

In this article, we propose a novel variant of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation that utilizes the continuous measurements for quantile estimation. The Robbins-Monro method has seldom seen clinical applications, because it does not perform well for quantile estimation with binary data and it works with a continuum of doses that are generally not available in practice. To address these issues, we formulate the dose-finding problem as root-finding for the mean of a continuous variable, for which the stochastic approximation procedure is efficient. To accommodate the use of discrete doses, we introduce the idea of virtual observation that is defined on a continuous dosage range.

This penalty plays two important roles: it reduces the effective number of parameters, which is important even when the dimension of the vectors is smaller than the sample size since the number of parameters grows quadratically in the number of variables, and it produces an estimate which is sparse. In contrast to sparse inverse covariance estimation, our method's close relative, the sparsity attained here is in the covariance matrix itself rather than in the inverse matrix. Zeros in the covariance matrix correspond to marginal independencies; thus, our method performs model selection while providing a positive definite estimate of the covariance. The proposed penalized maximum likelihood problem is not convex, so we use a majorize-minimize approach in which we iteratively solve convex approximations to the original nonconvex problem. We discuss tuning parameter selection and demonstrate on a flow-cytometry dataset how our method produces an interpretable graphical display of the relationship between variables.

Standard randomized controlled trials can have low power in such situations. They also are not optimized to distinguish which subpopulations benefit from a treatment. With the goal of overcoming these limitations, we consider randomized trial designs in which the criteria for patient enrollment may be changed, in a preplanned manner, based on interim analyses. Since such designs allow data-dependent changes to the population enrolled, care must be taken to ensure strong control of the familywise Type I error rate. Our main contribution is a general method for constructing randomized trial designs that allow changes to the population enrolled based on interim data using a prespecified decision rule, for which the asymptotic, familywise Type I error rate is strongly controlled at a specified level alpha. As a demonstration of our method, we prove new, sharp results for a simple, two-stage enrichment design. We then compare this design to fixed designs, focusing on each design's ability to determine the overall and subpopulation-specific treatment effects.", "keywords": ["adaptive design", "enrichment design", "group sequential design", "optimization", "patient-oriented research", "randomized trial", "subpopulation"], "keyword_plus": ["adaptive interim analyses", "clinical-trials", "treatment selection", "sequential designs", "hypotheses"], "university": ["Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Of Public Health", "University Of California System", "Johns Hopkins University", "University Of California Berkeley"]}, "cite_paper": {"adaptive two-stage test procedures to find the best treatment in clinical trials": {"author": ["Bischoff,W", "Miller,F"], "publisher": "biometrika", "publish_date": "2005-3"}, "estimation in flexible two stage designs": {"author": ["Brannath,Werner", "Konig,Franz", "Bauer,Peter"], "publisher": "statistics in medicine", "publish_date": "2006-10"}, "draft guidance for industry: adaptive design clinical trials for drugs and biologics": {"author": ["No Author"], "publisher": "draft guidance for industry: adaptive design clinical trials for drugs and biologics", "publish_date": "2010-6"}, "confirmatory seamless phase ii/iii clinical trials with hypotheses selection at interim: opportunities and limitations": {"author": ["Jennison,Christopher", "Turnbull,Bruce W."], "publisher": "biometrical journal", "publish_date": "2006-8"}, "adaptive seamless designs: selection and prospective testing of hypotheses": {"author": ["Jennison,Christopher", "Turnbull,Bruce W."], "publisher": "journal of biopharmaceutical statistics", "publish_date": "2007-6"}, "initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the food and drug administration": {"author": ["Kirsch,Irving", "Deacon,Brett J.", "Huedo-Medina,Tania B."], "publisher": "plos medicine", "publish_date": "2008-2"}, "testing and estimation in flexible group sequential designs with adaptive treatment selection": {"author": ["Posch,M", "Koenig,F", "Branson,M"], "publisher": "statistics in medicine", "publish_date": "2005-12"}, "drop-the-losers design: normal case": {"author": ["Sampson,Ar", "Sill,Mw"], "publisher": "biometrical journal", "publish_date": "2005-6"}, "adaptive patient enrichment designs in therapeutic trials": {"author": ["Wang,Sue-Jane", "Hung,H.

Such studies often rely on an assumption of unconfounded treatment when controlling for a given set of observed pre-treatment covariates. The choice of covariates to control in order to guarantee unconfoundedness should primarily be based on subject matter theories, although the latter typically give only partial guidance. It is tempting to include many covariates in the controlling set to try to make the assumption of an unconfounded treatment realistic. Including unnecessary covariates is suboptimal when the effect of a binary treatment is estimated nonparametrically. For instance, when using a n(1/2)-consistent estimator, a loss of efficiency may result from using covariates that are irrelevant for the unconfoundedness assumption. Moreover, bias may dominate the variance when many covariates are used. Embracing the Neyman-Rubin model typically used in conjunction with nonparametric estimators of treatment effects, we characterize subsets from the original reservoir of covariates that are minimal in the sense that the treatment ceases to be unconfounded given any proper subset of these minimal sets. These subsets of covariates are shown to be identified under mild assumptions.

Usually, the first stage involves randomization to one of the several initial treatments. The second stage of treatment begins when an early nonresponse criterion or response criterion is met. In the second-stage, nonresponding subjects are re-randomized among second-stage treatments. Sample size calculations for planning these two-stage randomized trials with failure time outcomes are challenging because the variances of common test statistics depend in a complex manner on the joint distribution of time to the early nonresponse criterion or response criterion and the primary failure time outcome.

In this paper we develop an estimator for such models appropriate for data from several graphical models that share the same variables and some of the dependence structure. In this setting, estimating a single graphical model would mask the underlying heterogeneity, while estimating separate models for each category does not take advantage of the common structure. We propose a method that jointly estimates the graphical models corresponding to the different categories present in the data, aiming to preserve the common structure, while allowing for differences between the categories.

The standard approach, logistic regression adjusting for both exposure and the mediator, is known to be biased in the presence of confounders for the mediator-outcome relationship. Because additional regression adjustment for such confounders is only justified when they are not affected by the exposure, inverse probability weighting has been advocated, but is not ideally tailored to mediators that are continuous or have strong measured predictors.

There are two parameters in the generalized t-link: one parameter purely controls the heaviness of the tails of the link and the second parameter controls the scale of the link. Two major advantages are offered by the generalized t-links. First, a symmetric generalized t-link with an unknown shape parameter is much more identifiable than a Student t-link with unknown degrees of freedom and a known scale parameter. Secondly, skewed generalized t-links with both unknown shape and scale parameters provide much more flexible and improved skewed link regression models than the existing skewed links.

Prediction intervals and a predictor for the population total are derived for the normal case, based on predictive likelihood. For a more general distribution-free model, by application of an analysis of variance approach instead of maximum likelihood for parameter estimation, the predictor obtained from the predictive likelihood is shown to be approximately uniformly optimal for large sample size and large number of clusters, in the sense of uniformly minimizing the mean-squared error in a partially linear class of model-unbiased predictors.

Model-based and design-based coverage properties of the prediction intervals are studied based on a comprehensive simulation study.

These spatial effects are customarily modelled as a zero-mean stationary Gaussian process. The spatial Dirichlet process introduced by Gelfand et al.

The spatial Dirichlet process arises as a probability-weighted collection of random surfaces. This can be limiting for modelling and inferential purposes since it insists that a process realization must be one of these surfaces. We introduce a random distribution for the spatial effects that allows different surface selection at different sites. Moreover, we can specify the model so that the marginal distribution of the effect at each site still comes from a Dirichlet process. The development is offered constructively, providing a multivariate extension of the stick-breaking representation of the weights.

In particular, selection-bias functions equal to zero encode the investigator's a priori belief that nonresponse of the next outcome does not depend on that outcome after adjusting for the observed past. We call this assumption sequential explainability. Since each model in our class is nonparametric, it fits the data perfectly well. As such, our models are ideal for conducting sensitivity analyses aimed at evaluating the impact that different degrees of departure from sequential explainability have on inference about the marginal means of interest. Although the marginal means are identified under each of our models, their estimation is not feasible in practice because it requires the auxiliary estimation of conditional expectations and probabilities given high-dimensional variables. We henceforth discuss the estimation of the marginal means under each model in our class assuming, additionally, that at each occasion either one of the following two models holds: a parametric model for the conditional probability of nonresponse given current outcomes and past recorded data or a parametric model for the conditional mean of the outcome on the nonrespondents given the past recorded data. We call the resulting procedure 2(T)-multiply robust as it protects at each of the T time points against misspecification of one of these two working models, although not against simultaneous misspecification of both.

The empirical likelihood method is used to estimate the regression coefficients and the baseline function, and to construct confidence regions and intervals. It is proved that the maximum empirical likelihood estimator of the regression coefficients achieves asymptotic efficiency and the estimator of the baseline function attains asymptotic normality when a bias correction is made. Two calibrated empirical likelihood approaches to inference for the baseline function are developed. We propose a groupwise empirical likelihood procedure to handle the inter-series dependence for the longitudinal semiparametric regression model, and employ bias correction to construct the empirical likelihood ratio functions for the parameters of interest.

Such designs are appropriately criticized in the context of clinical trials because they are subject to assignment bias. On the other hand, balanced randomized designs may assign an excessive number of patients to a treatment arm that is performing relatively poorly. We propose a compromise between these two extremes, one that achieves some of the good characteristics of both. We introduce a constrained optimal adaptive design for a fully sequential randomized clinical trial with k arms and n patients. An r-design is one for which, at each allocation, each arm has probability at least r of being chosen, 0 <= r <= 1/k. An optimal design among all r-designs is called r-optimal. An r(1)-design is also an r(2)-design if r(1) >= r(2). A design without constraint is the special case r = 0 and a balanced randomized design is the special case r = 1/k. The optimization criterion is to maximize the expected overall utility in a Bayesian decision-analytic approach, where utility is the sum over the utilities for individual patients over a 'patient horizon' N. We prove analytically that there exists an r-optimal design such that each patient is assigned to a particular one of the arms with probability 1 - ( k - 1) r, and to the remaining arms with probability r. We also show that the balanced design is asymptotically r-optimal for any given r, 0 <= r < 1/k, as N/n -> infinity. This implies that every r-optimal design is asymptotically optimal without constraint. Numerical computations using backward induction for k = 2 arms show that, in general, this asymptotic optimality feature for r-optimal designs can be accomplished with moderate trial size n if the patient horizon N is large relative to n. We also show that, in a trial with an r-optimal design, r < 1/2, fewer patients are assigned to an inferior arm than when following a balanced design, even for r-optimal designs having the same statistical power as a balanced design.
